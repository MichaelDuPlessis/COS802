# COS802 Project

This repo is all the code for my project for building a Multilngual SentenceBERT model that is finetuned on other langauges for a low number of epochs to possibly learn relations from langauges and then calculate the semantic similarity between two sentences of the same language.

## Structure

The main file is sol.ipynb which is a jupyter notebook which reads the data from hugging face and fine tunes the model. The results/ directory contains all the results ouptuted to a json file.
